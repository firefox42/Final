Description: The program (tentatively called "EconCalc") is an android application that allows the user to solve an input output matrix (also sometimes known as a Leontief matrix). Input output matrices are a useful tool in economics that allow people to see the total required production of interdependent commodities/services to meet a demand. They are extremely versatile in that you can be very specific in naming individual products (i.e. corn, oil, bottled water) or generalized to encompass entire sectors of the economy (i.e. agriculture, defense, healthcare). 
 
How to use: The user should run the app on any android device, and load a properly formatted .CSV file by entering the path it is stored and tapping "CALCULATE". The first line of the file should be the size of the input matrix (i.e. a 3x3 matrix should be 3), and the lines thereafter have each row of the the matrix, starting with the name of the commodity, the values of that row, and ending with the demand of that row. The app will then run the calculations, and output the results with the option of saving them as a .txt file or .png image file in the /sdcard/EconCalc/ directory.
